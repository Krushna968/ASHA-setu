  ASHA-SETU APP — INSTRUCTIONS FOR MEMBER 3 (Messenger UI + Docs — 10% of work)
  Branch: dev-testing-docs
================================================================================

Welcome to the ASHA-Setu project! You are responsible for improving the 
Messenger screen UI and writing project documentation. Read everything carefully.

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

ASHA-Setu is a mobile app for ASHA (community health) workers in India.
It helps them manage patients, track visits, manage inventory, and learn 
new health modules. The app is built with:

- Frontend: Flutter (Dart) — you will work on 1 screen here
- Backend:  Node.js + Express (DO NOT TOUCH)
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase (DO NOT TOUCH)

Tech Stack Summary (for your documentation):
- Flutter 3.x for cross-platform mobile app
- Node.js + Express.js for REST API backend
- Prisma ORM for database access
- PostgreSQL (Supabase) for database
- AWS SNS for SMS OTP authentication
- JWT tokens for session management

================================================================================
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone <REPO_URL>
   cd ASHA-Setuapp

2. Switch to YOUR branch:
   git checkout dev-testing-docs

3. Open the Flutter project:
   cd "App frontend"
   flutter pub get

4. You do NOT need the backend running for your work.
   You are making UI changes to 1 screen + writing documentation files.

================================================================================
YOUR 3 TASKS
================================================================================

TASK 1: Polish messenger_screen.dart
--------------------------------------
File: App frontend/lib/screens/messenger_screen.dart

This screen is the messaging/chat interface where ASHA workers can communicate 
with their district officers (admins) and other workers.

What to improve:
- Add chat bubble styling (sent messages on right in blue, received on left in grey)
- Add timestamp display below each message
- Add a typing indicator animation
- Add user avatar circles next to messages  
- Improve the message input bar (rounded corners, send button with icon)
- Add a "No messages yet" empty state with an illustration/icon
- Smooth scroll-to-bottom when new messages appear
- Use the dark theme from lib/theme/app_theme.dart

Design Reference:
- Look at WhatsApp or Telegram for chat UI inspiration
- Keep the dark theme consistent
- Messages should feel natural and easy to read


TASK 2: Create README.md
--------------------------
File: README.md (in the root ASHA-Setuapp/ folder)

Write a professional README.md for the GitHub repository. Include:

1. Project Title: ASHA-Setu — Digital Health Assistant for ASHA Workers
2. Project Description (2-3 paragraphs):
   - What the app does
   - Who it is for (ASHA workers in rural India)
   - What problem it solves (manual record-keeping, lack of communication)
3. Features List:
   - OTP-based phone login (AWS SNS)
   - Patient management (add, view, categorize by ANC/PNC/Infant/General)
   - Visit tracking with health vitals (BP, weight, temperature, blood sugar)
   - Task management (assigned by district officers)
   - Medical inventory tracking
   - Learning modules for continuous training
   - In-app messaging with district officers
   - Emergency contacts quick-dial
   - Calendar view for scheduled visits
   - Worker profile management
4. Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
   - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
   - Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
   - ORM: Prisma
   - Authentication: AWS SNS OTP + JWT
   - Cloud: AWS (SNS for SMS)

6. How to Run:
   - Backend: cd "App backend" → npm install → node index.js
   - Frontend: cd "App frontend" → flutter pub get → flutter run

TASK 3: Create FEATURES.md
-----------------------------
File: FEATURES.md (in the root ASHA-Setuapp/ folder)

- Feature name
- Description (1-2 sentences)
- Which screen implements it
- Key functionality

Features to document:

1. OTP Authentication

================================================================================
HOW TO USE ANTIGRAVITY (AI Assistant)
================================================================================

If you have access to Antigravity (Gemini Code Assist), here are prompts you 
can copy-paste to get help:

1. For Messenger UI:
   "I'm working on the ASHA-Setu Flutter app on branch dev-testing-docs.
    Polish the messenger_screen.dart to look like a modern chat app. 
    Add chat bubbles (sent on right in blue, received on left in grey), 
    timestamps, avatar circles, typing indicator animation, and a polished 
    message input bar. Follow the dark theme from lib/theme/app_theme.dart."

2. For README:
   "Create a professional README.md for the ASHA-Setu project. It's a Flutter + 
    Node.js mobile app for ASHA health workers in India. Features include: OTP 
    login via AWS SNS, patient management, visit tracking with vitals, task 
    management, inventory tracking, learning modules, messaging, emergency 
    contacts, and calendar. Tech stack: Flutter, Node.js, Express, Prisma, 
    PostgreSQL (Supabase), AWS SNS, JWT."

3. For FEATURES.md:
   "Create a detailed FEATURES.md documenting all 11 features of the ASHA-Setu 
    app. For each feature, describe what it does, which Flutter screen implements 
    it, and the key functionality. Features: OTP Auth, Dashboard, Patient Mgmt, 
    Visit Tracking, Calendar, Inventory, Learning, Messaging, Emergency, Help, 
    Profile."

Important: Tell Antigravity you are ONLY working on messenger_screen.dart UI 
and documentation files on your branch (dev-testing-docs). Do NOT touch backend.

================================================================================
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
================================================================================

1. Test messenger_screen.dart on an emulator
2. Proofread README.md and FEATURES.md
3. Commit your changes:
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Polish messenger UI and add project documentation"
4. Push to your branch:
   git push origin dev-testing-docs
5. Tell Krushna on WhatsApp that you're done

DEADLINE: March 5th, 2026
