  ASHA-SETU APP — COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUDRA
  Your Git Branch: dev-rudra
  Your Role: UI/UX Polish Developer (10% of project)
  Deadline: 3rd March 2026
================================================================================
================================================================================


Hi Rudra! Welcome aboard the ASHA-Setu project. This file contains EVERYTHING
you need to know. Read it top to bottom before you start coding.


================================================================================
PART 1: WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
================================================================================

ASHA-Setu is a mobile app built for ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) 
workers in India. These are community health workers who go door-to-door in 
rural areas to track pregnancies, infant health, immunizations, etc.

This app helps them:
- Log in with OTP (SMS verification)
- See their daily dashboard with pending tasks
- Manage their assigned patients
- Log patient visits with health vitals (BP, weight, etc.)
- View their visit calendar
- Track medical supply inventory (medicines, kits)
- Learn new health modules (training videos/articles)
- Send messages to their district officer
- Access emergency contacts for quick dial
- Get help & FAQs
- Manage their own profile

The app has TWO parts:
1. "App frontend" folder = Flutter mobile app (Dart language)
2. "App backend" folder = Node.js server (JavaScript) — YOU WILL NOT TOUCH THIS

You will ONLY work inside the "App frontend" folder.


================================================================================
PART 2: TECH STACK (so you understand the project)
================================================================================

Frontend (YOUR area):
- Flutter 3.x (Dart programming language)
- Material Design widgets
- Custom dark theme (defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart)

Backend (DO NOT TOUCH):
- Node.js + Express.js
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database (hosted on Supabase)
- AWS SNS for OTP SMS
- JWT for authentication


================================================================================
PART 3: HOW TO SET UP THE PROJECT ON YOUR MACHINE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Make sure you have these installed:
  - Git (https://git-scm.com/)
  - Flutter SDK (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
  - Android Studio (for Android emulator) OR a physical Android phone
  - VS Code with Flutter + Dart extensions (recommended)

STEP 2: Clone the repository
  Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
  
  git clone https://github.com/Krushna968/ASHA-setu.git
  cd ASHA-setu

STEP 3: Switch to YOUR branch
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT work on the main branch. Switch to your branch:
  
  git checkout dev-rudra

STEP 4: Install Flutter dependencies
  cd "App frontend"
  flutter pub get

STEP 5: Run the app to see the current state
  flutter run
  
  NOTE: The app is now connected to a LIVE production backend on Render! 🚀
  You can now actually log in and test everything without running a local backend.
  Simply use your registered phone number (8652075823) and you will receive a real OTP.

  TIP: To preview a specific screen without navigating, you can temporarily 
  change the home route in lib/main.dart...
  
  // Change this line temporarily:
  home: LoginScreen(),
  // To this:
  home: HelpSupportScreen(),

  Remember to change it BACK before committing!

  ALTERNATIVELY: You can run the backend too and test the FULL app flow 
  (login with OTP, navigate to screens, etc.). See PART 3B below.


================================================================================
PART 3B: HOW TO RUN THE BACKEND (Optional — For Full Testing)
================================================================================

If you want to test the full app (with login, OTP, etc.), you need to run 
the backend server on your machine. Here's how:

STEP 1: Install Node.js
  - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (use the LTS version)
  - Verify: Open terminal and run: node --version

STEP 2: Install backend dependencies
  cd "App backend"
  npm install

STEP 3: Create the .env file
  Create a file called ".env" (just .env, no other name) inside the 
  "App backend" folder. Paste this EXACT content:

  ⚠️ ASK KRUSHNA on WhatsApp — he will send you the .env file contents.
  He cannot put it on GitHub because it contains secret keys (AWS, Database).
  
  The .env file should have these 6 variables:
    DATABASE_URL="..."     (Supabase PostgreSQL connection string)
    JWT_SECRET="..."       (Secret key for authentication tokens)
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."  (AWS credentials for OTP SMS)
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."  (AWS credentials for OTP SMS)
    AWS_REGION="ap-south-1"
    PORT=5000

  Krushna will WhatsApp you the exact values to paste.

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT share this .env file with anyone outside the team.
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit this file to Git (it's already in .gitignore).

STEP 4: Generate Prisma Client
  npx prisma generate

STEP 5: Start the backend server
  node index.js

  You should see: "Server running on port 5000"
  The backend is now running at http://localhost:5000

STEP 6: Update the Flutter app (Already Done on main)
  Open: App frontend/lib/services/api_service.dart
  
  The `baseUrl` is already set to the live Render backend:
  `static const String baseUrl = 'https://asha-setu-backend.onrender.com/api';`

  You can use this live backend for testing, or if you want to run your own 
  local backend, change it to your IP as shown below:
  
  If testing on EMULATOR (Android Studio emulator):
    static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:5000/api';
  
  If testing on PHYSICAL PHONE (connected to same WiFi as your PC):
    Step A: Find your PC's IP address:
      - Windows: Open cmd → type: ipconfig → look for "IPv4 Address" 
        (usually something like 192.168.x.x)
      - Mac: System Preferences → Network → look for IP
    Step B: Use that IP in baseUrl:
      static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000/api';
      Example: static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.5:5000/api';
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change this BACK to the original before committing!
  ⚠️ DO NOT commit your local IP address.

STEP 7: Test login with YOUR number
  - Run the Flutter app: flutter run
  - Enter YOUR phone number: 8652075823
  - You will receive an OTP via SMS to your phone
  - Enter the OTP and you'll be logged in to the dashboard
  - Your profile: Name = "Rudra", Area = "Panvel"
  - From there you can navigate to any screen to test your UI changes

  NOTE: Registered phone numbers in the system:
  - Your number: 8652075823 (Worker: Rudra, Area: Panvel)
  - Raj's number: 9137113650 (Worker: Raj, Area: Kalyan)
  - Krushna's number (already registered)


================================================================================
PART 4: YOUR 3 TASKS — WHAT EXACTLY TO DO
================================================================================

You are responsible for making 3 specific Flutter screens look modern, 
beautiful, and professional. These screens currently work but look basic.
Your job is to make them STUNNING.

The app uses a DARK THEME. All colors, text styles, and design tokens are 
defined in this file — READ IT FIRST:

  File: App frontend/lib/theme/app_theme.dart

Use the colors and styles from AppTheme in all your work. Do NOT use random 
colors. Stay consistent with the rest of the app.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 1: Redesign help_support_screen.dart
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

File Location: App frontend/lib/screens/help_support_screen.dart
Lines of Code: ~340 lines

WHAT THIS SCREEN DOES:
This screen shows FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), help articles, and 
support contact information for ASHA workers who need guidance.

CURRENT STATE:
The screen exists and has content, but looks plain and basic.

WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPROVE — CHECKLIST:

  □ Add a SEARCH BAR at the very top of the screen
    - Allow users to type and filter FAQs
    - Use a rounded TextField with a search icon
    - Filtering logic is optional — just the UI is fine

  □ Make FAQ items EXPANDABLE with smooth animation
    - Use ExpansionTile or custom AnimatedContainer
    - When a user taps a question, the answer slides open smoothly
    - Add a rotating arrow icon to indicate expand/collapse

  □ Replace plain white cards with GRADIENT CARDS
    - Use subtle dark gradients (not bright colors)
    - Example: LinearGradient from AppTheme.cardColor to a slightly lighter shade
    - Add rounded corners (BorderRadius.circular(16))

  □ Add ICONS next to each FAQ question
    - Use relevant Material Icons (e.g., Icons.help_outline, Icons.phone, etc.)
    - Place them on the left side of each question

  □ Make the "Contact Support" section PROMINENT
    - Use a larger card with a gradient background
    - Add a phone icon and a "Call Now" button
    - Make the phone number large and tappable

  □ Add MICRO-ANIMATIONS
    - Fade-in animation when the screen loads (use AnimatedOpacity or FadeTransition)
    - Slide-in animation for each card (staggered, one after another)
    - You can use the 'animate_do' package if needed (add to pubspec.yaml)

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Think of a modern FAQ page from any premium app. Clean, organized, with subtle 
animations that make it feel alive.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 2: Redesign learning_screen.dart
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

File Location: App frontend/lib/screens/learning_screen.dart
Lines of Code: ~340 lines

WHAT THIS SCREEN DOES:
This screen shows training/learning modules for ASHA workers. Each module 
can be a video, article, or quiz on health topics like Nutrition, Maternal 
Health, Infant Care, etc.

CURRENT STATE:
The screen has a list of modules but looks basic and list-like.

WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPROVE — CHECKLIST:

  □ Add CATEGORY FILTER CHIPS at the top
    - Horizontal scrollable row of chips: "All", "Nutrition", "Maternal Health", 
      "Infant Care", "Immunization", "General"
    - Use Chip or ChoiceChip widgets
    - Highlight the selected chip with AppTheme.accentColor
    - Filtering logic is optional — just the UI is fine

  □ Add a "CONTINUE LEARNING" section
    - Show the last module the user was working on
    - Display it as a large highlighted card at the top
    - Show a progress bar (e.g., "60% complete")
    - Add a "Continue" button

  □ Make each module a CARD with:
    - A thumbnail area on the left (use a colored Container with an icon as placeholder)
    - Module title (bold)
    - Module description (smaller text, 1-2 lines max)
    - Duration label (e.g., "15 min")
    - A progress indicator:
      * Not Started = grey outline
      * In Progress = partially filled bar with percentage
      * Completed = green checkmark

  □ Add SMOOTH TRANSITIONS between module states
    - When a module changes from "Not Started" to "In Progress", animate it
    - Use AnimatedContainer or Hero animations

  □ Add STAGGERED ANIMATIONS when the list loads
    - Each card should slide in from the bottom one after another
    - Use a small delay between each card (100ms stagger)

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Think of Coursera, Udemy, or Duolingo's module list. Clean cards with progress 
indicators and category filters.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 3: Redesign emergency_screen.dart
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

File Location: App frontend/lib/screens/emergency_screen.dart
Lines of Code: ~300 lines

WHAT THIS SCREEN DOES:
This screen shows emergency contact numbers (hospitals, ambulance, poison 
control, etc.) that ASHA workers can tap to quickly call during emergencies.

CURRENT STATE:
The screen has a list of numbers but doesn't feel "urgent" enough.

WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPROVE — CHECKLIST:

  □ Add a BOLD SOS-STYLE HEADER
    - Large "EMERGENCY" text with a warning icon
    - Use red/orange colors to convey urgency
    - Maybe a subtle pulsing or glowing effect on the header

  □ Make the PRIMARY EMERGENCY NUMBER (112 or Ambulance) HUGE
    - A large red circular button in the center
    - Add a PULSING ANIMATION (the button grows and shrinks gently)
    - Use AnimatedContainer or AnimationController for the pulse
    - Label it "TAP TO CALL" below the number

  □ GROUP contacts by category
    - Use section headers: "🏥 Hospital", "🚑 Ambulance", "☎️ Helpline", etc.
    - Each category should be a separate card/section

  □ Make each contact number a LARGE TAPPABLE CARD
    - Show the contact name, number, and a big phone icon
    - Use red/orange gradient backgrounds
    - The entire card should be tappable (use InkWell or GestureDetector)
    - Optionally use url_launcher package to actually dial the number

  □ Use RED/ORANGE COLOR SCHEME
    - This screen should feel DIFFERENT from the rest of the app
    - Use warm, urgent colors: reds, oranges, deep crimsons
    - The background can have a subtle red gradient

  □ Ensure ACCESSIBILITY
    - Text should be LARGE and readable (minimum 18sp for numbers)
    - Buttons should be big enough for panicked tapping
    - Test on both small (5-inch) and large (6.5-inch) screens

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Think of an emergency SOS app. Big buttons, red colors, pulsing animations, 
zero confusion — the user should be able to call help in 2 seconds flat.


================================================================================
PART 5: STRICT RULES — READ CAREFULLY
================================================================================

✅ YOU MAY:
  - Edit ONLY these 3 files:
    1. App frontend/lib/screens/help_support_screen.dart
    2. App frontend/lib/screens/learning_screen.dart
    3. App frontend/lib/screens/emergency_screen.dart
  - Use colors and styles from lib/theme/app_theme.dart
  - Add visual Flutter packages to pubspec.yaml ONLY if needed 
    (e.g., shimmer, animate_do, url_launcher)
    → But TELL KRUSHNA first before adding any package
  - Use Flutter's built-in animation widgets
  - Test your changes on an emulator or physical device

❌ YOU MAY NOT:
  - Touch ANY file in "App backend/" folder — DO NOT EVEN OPEN IT
  - Edit login_screen.dart, otp_screen.dart, dashboard_screen.dart, 
    patients_screen.dart, add_patient_screen.dart, visit_form_screen.dart,
    calendar_screen.dart, inventory_screen.dart, profile_screen.dart, 
    messenger_screen.dart, or main_screen.dart
  - Edit api_service.dart or auth_service.dart
  - Edit main.dart (except temporarily to preview your screen)
  - Push to main branch — ONLY push to dev-rudra
  - Change any backend logic, API calls, or database code


================================================================================
PART 6: HOW TO USE ANTIGRAVITY (AI Coding Assistant)
================================================================================

If you have access to Antigravity (Gemini Code Assist in your IDE), you can 
use it to help you code these UI improvements. Here are EXACT prompts you 
can copy-paste into Antigravity:

─── PROMPT FOR TASK 1 (Help & Support Screen) ───

"I am working on a Flutter app called ASHA-Setu. My Git branch is dev-rudra.
I need to redesign the file: lib/screens/help_support_screen.dart

The app uses a dark theme defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart — please use 
those colors and styles.

Please make these improvements:
1. Add a search bar at the top to filter FAQs (rounded, with search icon)
2. Make FAQ items expandable with smooth slide animation
3. Replace plain cards with subtle dark gradient cards (rounded corners 16px)
4. Add Material Icons next to each FAQ question
5. Make the Contact Support section prominent with a gradient card and call button
6. Add fade-in and slide-in micro-animations when the screen loads

Keep the dark theme. Make it look premium and modern. Do NOT change any other 
files. Do NOT touch backend code."

─── PROMPT FOR TASK 2 (Learning Screen) ───

"I am working on a Flutter app called ASHA-Setu. My Git branch is dev-rudra.
I need to redesign the file: lib/screens/learning_screen.dart

The app uses a dark theme defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart — please use 
those colors and styles.

Please make these improvements:
1. Add horizontal scrollable category filter chips at top (All, Nutrition, 
   Maternal Health, Infant Care, Immunization, General)
2. Add a 'Continue Learning' highlighted card at the top showing last module 
   with progress bar and Continue button
3. Make each module a card with thumbnail area, title, description, duration, 
   and a circular/linear progress indicator
4. Add staggered slide-in animations when cards load (100ms delay between each)
5. Smooth transitions for module state changes

Keep the dark theme. Make it look like Coursera or Duolingo module list. 
Do NOT change any other files. Do NOT touch backend code."

─── PROMPT FOR TASK 3 (Emergency Screen) ───

"I am working on a Flutter app called ASHA-Setu. My Git branch is dev-rudra.
I need to redesign the file: lib/screens/emergency_screen.dart

The app uses a dark theme defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart — but this 
screen should use RED/ORANGE urgent colors instead of the normal dark theme.

Please make these improvements:
1. Add a bold SOS-style header with 'EMERGENCY' text and warning icon
2. Make the primary emergency number (112/Ambulance) a LARGE red circular 
   button with a pulsing/breathing animation
3. Group contacts by category (Hospital, Ambulance, Helpline) with section headers
4. Make each contact a large tappable card with red/orange gradient background
5. Use large text (min 18sp for numbers) for accessibility
6. Add subtle red gradient to the screen background

Make it feel URGENT — big buttons, red colors, pulsing animations. The user 
should be able to call for help in 2 seconds. Do NOT change any other files. 
Do NOT touch backend code."


================================================================================
PART 7: HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK
