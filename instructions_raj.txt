  ASHA-SETU APP — COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RAJ
  Your Git Branch: dev-raj
  Your Role: Messenger UI + Project Documentation (10% of project)
  Deadline: 3rd March 2026
================================================================================
================================================================================


Hi Raj! Welcome aboard the ASHA-Setu project. This file contains EVERYTHING
you need to know. Read it top to bottom before you start coding.


================================================================================
PART 1: WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
================================================================================

ASHA-Setu is a mobile app built for ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) 
workers in India. These are community health workers who go door-to-door in 
rural areas to track pregnancies, infant health, immunizations, etc.

This app helps them:
- Log in with OTP (SMS verification)
- See their daily dashboard with pending tasks
- Manage their assigned patients
- Log patient visits with health vitals (BP, weight, etc.)
- View their visit calendar
- Track medical supply inventory (medicines, kits)
- Learn new health modules (training videos/articles)
- Send messages to their district officer
- Access emergency contacts for quick dial
- Get help & FAQs
- Manage their own profile

The app has TWO parts:
1. "App frontend" folder = Flutter mobile app (Dart language)
2. "App backend" folder = Node.js server (JavaScript) — YOU WILL NOT TOUCH THIS

You will ONLY work inside the "App frontend" folder (for 1 screen) and the 
root folder (for documentation files).


================================================================================
PART 2: TECH STACK (so you understand the project for documentation)
================================================================================

Frontend:
- Flutter 3.x (Dart programming language)
- Material Design widgets
- Custom dark theme (defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart)

Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js (REST API)
- Prisma ORM (database query builder)
- PostgreSQL database (hosted on Supabase cloud)
- AWS SNS for OTP SMS delivery
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session authentication

Infrastructure:
- GitHub for version control
- Supabase for database hosting
- AWS for SMS delivery
- Vercel for admin web portal hosting (separate project)


================================================================================
PART 3: HOW TO SET UP THE PROJECT ON YOUR MACHINE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Make sure you have these installed:
  - Git (https://git-scm.com/)
  - Flutter SDK (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
  - Android Studio (for Android emulator) OR a physical Android phone
  - VS Code with Flutter + Dart extensions (recommended)
  - Any Markdown editor (VS Code works, or use https://stackedit.io/)

STEP 2: Clone the repository
  Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
  
  git clone https://github.com/Krushna968/ASHA-setu.git
  cd ASHA-setu

STEP 3: Switch to YOUR branch
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT work on the main branch. Switch to your branch:
  
  git checkout dev-raj

STEP 4: Install Flutter dependencies (for the messenger screen task)
  cd "App frontend"
  flutter pub get

STEP 5: Run the app to see the current state
  flutter run
  
  NOTE: The app will show a login screen. Since you don't have the backend 
  running, you can't actually log in. That's fine.

  TIP: To preview the messenger screen without logging in, temporarily 
  change the home route in lib/main.dart:
  
  // Change this line temporarily:
  home: LoginScreen(),
  // To this:
  home: MessengerScreen(),
  
  (You'll need to add the import at the top of main.dart too)
  Remember to change it BACK to LoginScreen() before committing!

  ALTERNATIVELY: You can run the backend and test the FULL app flow 
  (login with YOUR phone number 9137113650, navigate to screens, etc.). 
  See PART 3B below.


================================================================================
PART 3B: HOW TO RUN THE BACKEND (Optional — For Full Testing)
================================================================================

If you want to test the full app (login with OTP, navigate to all screens),
you need to run the backend server. YOUR PHONE NUMBER (9137113650) IS ALREADY 
REGISTERED IN THE DATABASE as a worker in Kalyan — so you can actually log in!

STEP 1: Install Node.js
  - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (use the LTS version)
  - Verify: Open terminal and run: node --version

STEP 2: Install backend dependencies
  cd "App backend"
  npm install

STEP 3: Create the .env file
  Create a file called ".env" (just .env, no other name) inside the 
  "App backend" folder. Paste this EXACT content:

  ⚠️ ASK KRUSHNA on WhatsApp — he will send you the .env file contents.
  He cannot put it on GitHub because it contains secret keys (AWS, Database).
  
  The .env file should have these 6 variables:
    DATABASE_URL="..."     (Supabase PostgreSQL connection string)
    JWT_SECRET="..."       (Secret key for authentication tokens)
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."  (AWS credentials for OTP SMS)
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."  (AWS credentials for OTP SMS)
    AWS_REGION="ap-south-1"
    PORT=5000

  Krushna will WhatsApp you the exact values to paste.

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT share this .env file with anyone outside the team.
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit this file to Git (it's already in .gitignore).

STEP 4: Generate Prisma Client
  npx prisma generate

STEP 5: Start the backend server
  node index.js

  You should see: "Server running on port 5000"
  The backend is now running at http://localhost:5000

STEP 6: Update the Flutter app to point to YOUR backend
  Open: App frontend/lib/services/api_service.dart
  
  Find the line that says "baseUrl" and change it to YOUR computer's IP:
  
  If testing on EMULATOR (Android Studio emulator):
    static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:5000/api';
  
  If testing on PHYSICAL PHONE (connected to same WiFi as your PC):
    Step A: Find your PC's IP address:
      - Windows: Open cmd → type: ipconfig → look for "IPv4 Address" 
        (usually something like 192.168.x.x)
      - Mac: System Preferences → Network → look for IP
    Step B: Use that IP in baseUrl:
      static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000/api';
      Example: static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.5:5000/api';
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change this BACK to the original before committing!
  ⚠️ DO NOT commit your local IP address.

STEP 7: Test login with YOUR number
  - Run the Flutter app: flutter run
  - Enter YOUR phone number: 9137113650
  - You will receive an OTP via SMS to your phone
  - Enter the OTP and you'll be logged in to the dashboard
  - Your profile: Name = "Raj", Area = "Kalyan"
  - From there you can navigate to the messenger screen to test your UI changes

  NOTE: Registered phone numbers in the system:
  - Your number: 9137113650 (Worker: Raj, Area: Kalyan)
  - Krushna's number (already registered)


================================================================================
PART 4: YOUR 3 TASKS — WHAT EXACTLY TO DO
================================================================================

You have 3 tasks: 1 Flutter UI task + 2 documentation tasks.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 1: Redesign messenger_screen.dart
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

File Location: App frontend/lib/screens/messenger_screen.dart
Lines of Code: ~300 lines

WHAT THIS SCREEN DOES:
This is the in-app messaging/chat screen where ASHA workers can communicate 
with their district officers (supervisors) and potentially other workers.
Think of it like a simple WhatsApp chat interface.

CURRENT STATE:
The screen has basic messaging functionality but the UI looks plain and 
doesn't feel like a real chat app.

WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPROVE — CHECKLIST:

  □ CHAT BUBBLES — Proper message bubble styling
    - Sent messages: Align to RIGHT side, use blue/accent color background
    - Received messages: Align to LEFT side, use grey/dark color background
    - Bubbles should have rounded corners (more rounded on the sender's side)
    - Use Container with BoxDecoration and BorderRadius
    - Example shapes:
      * Sent:    rounded top-left, top-right, bottom-left (sharp bottom-right)
      * Received: rounded top-left, top-right, bottom-right (sharp bottom-left)

  □ TIMESTAMPS below each message
    - Show time in "hh:mm AM/PM" format
    - Use small, grey text (10sp or 11sp)
    - Position below each bubble, aligned with the bubble

  □ USER AVATAR circles next to messages
    - Small circular avatar (32x32) next to received messages
    - Use CircleAvatar widget with the first letter of the sender's name
    - Use different colors for different senders
    - No avatar needed for sent messages (they're yours)

  □ TYPING INDICATOR animation
    - Show 3 bouncing dots when the other person is typing
    - Use a Row of 3 small circles with staggered bounce animation
    - This can be a static UI element (you don't need real-time data)
    - Place it at the bottom of the chat, above the input bar

  □ MESSAGE INPUT BAR redesign
    - Rounded TextField with padding
    - Hint text: "Type a message..."
    - Send button on the right side with an arrow/send icon
    - Send button should be a circular IconButton with accent color
    - The input bar should have a slightly different background from the chat area
    - Optional: Add an attachment icon (camera/file) on the left

  □ EMPTY STATE — "No messages yet"
    - When there are no messages, show a centered illustration
    - Use an icon (Icons.chat_bubble_outline or Icons.forum) with grey color
    - Add text: "No messages yet" and "Start a conversation with your supervisor"
    - This should look clean and inviting, not boring

  □ SCROLL TO BOTTOM behavior
    - New messages should auto-scroll to the bottom
    - Use ScrollController with animateTo
    - Add a "scroll to bottom" floating button if the user has scrolled up

  □ OVERALL POLISH
    - Follow the dark theme from lib/theme/app_theme.dart
    - Smooth animations when new messages appear
    - The screen should feel like WhatsApp or Telegram — fluid and responsive

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Open WhatsApp or Telegram on your phone. Look at:
- How chat bubbles are shaped and colored
- How timestamps are positioned
- How the input bar looks
- The overall feel of the chat screen
Replicate that level of polish in the ASHA-Setu messenger screen.

If you have access to Antigravity (Gemini Code Assist in your IDE), here are 
EXACT prompts you can copy-paste:

─── PROMPT FOR TASK 1 (Messenger Screen) ───

"I am working on a Flutter app called ASHA-Setu. My Git branch is dev-raj.
I need to redesign the file: lib/screens/messenger_screen.dart

The app uses a dark theme defined in lib/theme/app_theme.dart — please use 
those colors and styles.

Please make these improvements to create a WhatsApp/Telegram-like chat UI:
1. Chat bubbles — sent messages on right (blue/accent), received on left (grey)
   with proper rounded corners
2. Timestamps below each message in small grey text
3. Circular user avatars (32x32) next to received messages
4. A typing indicator with 3 bouncing dots animation
5. Redesigned message input bar with rounded TextField, send icon button, 
   and optional attachment icon
6. Empty state with icon and 'No messages yet' text when no messages exist
7. Auto-scroll to bottom for new messages with a floating scroll-down button

Keep the dark theme. Make it feel like a real messaging app (WhatsApp/Telegram).
Do NOT change any other files. Do NOT touch backend code."

─── PROMPT FOR TASK 2 (README) ───

"Create a professional README.md for a project called ASHA-Setu. It is a 
Flutter + Node.js mobile app for ASHA health workers in rural India.

1. Title with badges (Flutter, Node.js, License)
2. Project description (3 paragraphs about what it does, who it's for, problem it solves)
3. Features list with emojis (OTP login, dashboard, patient management, visit tracking,
   calendar, inventory, learning modules, messaging, emergency contacts, help, profile)
4. Tech stack table (Flutter, Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL/Supabase, AWS SNS, JWT)
5. Project structure tree
6. Getting started / how to run (backend + frontend setup)
7. Database schema overview (9 models: Worker, Patient, Household, Task, etc.)
8. API endpoints overview
9. Team table (Krushna - Lead 80%, Rudra - UI 10%, Raj - Docs & Messenger 10%)
10. MIT License

Make it look clean, professional, and well-formatted with proper markdown."
